# Demo for the submission 'Attention-with-logits: an End-to-end Weakly Supervised Approach for Sentence-level Sentiment Classification' 

To run the notebook file, it is better to import it into an enviroment with a gpu. Becuse of the storage limit, the data used in the accopmying paper cannot be included. Instead, we chose to read the data from IBM's cloud service.
Furthermore, for some procedural reasons, only a small part of the data described in the accompying paper is used in this file. The compelete datasets will be released soon. 

Readers can also supply their own data to run the file. We observed that it is easy to reproduce the advantage of the proposed approach reported in the paper on a new dataset other than the ones described in the paper.
